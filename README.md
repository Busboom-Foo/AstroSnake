# AstroSnake

Astroids Snake game, a compbination of Asteroids and Snake game.

This game is primarily built with AI, using prompts in the /prompts directory.
The first prompt is to greate a feature overview of the game, based on research
and a bit of synthesis. After generating a feature description, additional
prompts are used to create a spec for the game, and then another prompt to
actually write the code. 


## Research Prompt

The [first research prompt ](docs/research_prompt_1.md) was intended to create a
feature overview, but instead it went into detail of data structures and other
aspects of the programming.
