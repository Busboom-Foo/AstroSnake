# Prompt

I want you to find some sites or forum posts that describe the game Asteroids
and the game Snake, then you are going to create a detailed description of a
combined game, Astersnake. The description should describe all of the features
of Astersnake, to a level of detail that a game designer could write a detailed
software specification. The game should have enough features to make it fun and
interesting, but should be implementable by a junior programmer, perhaps as the
final project for a coding bootcamp. In python or Javascrip the game should be
implementable as a single file.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Title:** Astersnake
**Genre:** Arcade / Action / Survival
**Target Platform:** Desktop (Web or Local)
**Implementation Language:** Python (with Pygame) or JavaScript (with HTML5 Canvas)
**Project Scope:** Single-file implementation suitable for a junior developer's final project([Wikipedia, l'enciclopedia libera][1])

## üöÄ Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. Player Entity: The Snake-Ship

* **Representation:** A triangular spaceship (inspired by *Asteroids*) with a trailing tail that grows as the player collects items.
* **Movement:**

  * **Rotation:** Left and right arrow keys rotate the ship.
  * **Thrust:** Up arrow key applies forward thrust, incorporating inertia (Newtonian physics) as in *Asteroids*.
  * **Friction:** Minimal friction to allow for continuous movement unless counter-thrust is applied.
* **Tail Mechanics:**

  * **Growth:** Collecting energy orbs increases tail length.
  * **Collision:** Colliding with the tail results in game over, similar to *Snake*.([Wikipedia][2], [Android Apps on Google Play][3])

### 2. Environment: The Asteroid Field

* **Screen Wrapping:** Objects exiting one edge of the screen re-enter from the opposite edge, creating a toroidal space.
* **Asteroids:**

  * **Sizes:** Large, medium, and small.
  * **Behavior:** Large asteroids break into medium ones when shot; medium break into small; small are destroyed upon being shot.
  * **Movement:** Random trajectories with varying speeds.
* **Enemy Saucers:**

  * **Types:** Large and small.
  * **Behavior:** Enter the screen at intervals, shooting at the player.
  * **Scoring:** Destroying saucers yields higher points.([StrategyWiki][4], [WIRED][5], [Giant Bomb][6], [Snake - Classic Arcade Game][7])

### 3. Combat and Scoring

* **Weapons:**

  * **Primary Fire:** Spacebar fires bullets in the direction the ship is facing.
  * **Hyperspace (Optional):** A panic button that teleports the ship to a random location, with a risk of immediate collision.
* **Scoring System:**

  * **Asteroids:** Points awarded based on size (e.g., large: 20, medium: 50, small: 100).
  * **Saucers:** Higher points for smaller, more aggressive saucers (e.g., large: 200, small: 1000).
  * **Energy Orbs:** Collected to grow the tail; each orb adds to the score.([Classic Gaming][8], [classicgamerevival.com][9], [Wikipedia, l'enciclopedia libera][1])

### 4. Game Progression

#  Prompt Revision

No, that is too detailed; it should not have anything about implementation. It
should be more narrative, describing how the game works. Nothing about objects,
or the main loop.

[![Arcade1Up, Asteroids Arcade Machine, 4ft - Walmart.com](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.E3y63Brc0J2uLoPjplzjUQHaLH\&pid=Api)](https://www.walmart.com/ip/arcade1up-asteroids-machine-4ft/828150107)

Introducing **Astersnake**, a captivating fusion of two iconic arcade games:
*Asteroids* and *Snake*. This game combines the thrilling space combat of
*Asteroids* with the strategic growth mechanics of *Snake*, delivering a unique
and engaging experience.

---

### üêçüöÄ Game Overview

In **Astersnake**, players pilot a nimble spacecraft through a treacherous
asteroid field. The objective is to collect energy orbs scattered throughout
space, each of which extends the ship's trailing energy tail. As the tail grows
longer, maneuvering becomes increasingly challenging, requiring players to
deftly navigate without colliding with their own tail or the surrounding
asteroids.

---

### üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

* **Ship Control**: Players have full control over their spacecraft's rotation and thrust, allowing for precise navigation through the asteroid-laden environment.

* **Energy Orbs**: Scattered throughout the field, these orbs are the key to increasing your score and tail length. Each collected orb adds a segment to your tail, enhancing both the challenge and your point tally.

* **Asteroids**: These drifting hazards vary in size and speed. Larger asteroids can split into smaller fragments when shot, increasing the density of obstacles and the difficulty of navigation.([StrategyWiki][1])

* **Tail Management**: As your tail grows, it becomes a moving obstacle. Colliding with your own tail results in a game over, so strategic movement and planning are essential.

* **Enemy Saucers**: Occasionally, alien saucers will enter the field, firing projectiles at your ship. Destroying them yields bonus points but also adds to the complexity of the environment.

---

### üåå Game Progression

The game features multiple levels, each increasing in difficulty with more
asteroids, faster enemy saucers, and additional energy orbs. As players advance,
they must balance the desire for a higher score with the risks of a longer tail
and denser asteroid fields.

---

### üèÜ Scoring System

* **Energy Orbs**: +10 points each.([Wikipedia][2])

* **Asteroids**:

  * Large: +20 points.
  * Medium: +50 points.
  * Small: +100 points.([StrategyWiki][1])

* **Enemy Saucers**:

  * Large: +200 points.
  * Small: +1000 points.

The game ends when the player collides with an asteroid, their own tail, or is
destroyed by an enemy saucer. The final score reflects the player's skill in
navigating the hazards, collecting energy orbs, and eliminating threats.([Snake
Game][3])

---

### üé® Visual and Audio Design

* **Graphics**: A blend of retro vector-style visuals reminiscent of *Asteroids*, combined with the vibrant colors associated with *Snake*, creating a nostalgic yet fresh aesthetic.

* **Sound**: Classic arcade sound effects accompany actions such as firing, collecting orbs, and explosions, enhancing the immersive experience.

---

### üß† Strategic Depth

**Astersnake** challenges players to think ahead, plan their movements, and make
split-second decisions. The growing tail adds a layer of complexity, forcing
players to consider their past paths and avoid self-collision, while the dynamic
asteroid field and enemy saucers require constant vigilance and adaptability.

---

**Astersnake** offers a compelling blend of action and strategy, paying homage
to two classic games while introducing innovative gameplay mechanics. It's a
test of reflexes, planning, and spatial awareness, providing endless
entertainment for both casual players and arcade enthusiasts.
